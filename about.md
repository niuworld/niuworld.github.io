I am a postgraduate student majoring in Electronic Engineering in Tianjin University, China. I am taking a exchange program in Chang Gung University, Taiwan.I have great interest in Computer Science. 

I am a life-long learner. I just start to learn something about Computer Science half a year ago. But I am really addicted to it now.

I am a couchsurfer and world-travller. I have been to some countries in Southeastern Asia, like Vietname, Cambodia, Malaysia and Phillipines. I have also explored alone in Middle East, like Iran.

My full-time job is preserving my youth.
