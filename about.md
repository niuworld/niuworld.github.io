I was born in a small town in Heilongjiang Province, China. Taking a 26-hour train to beijing at the age of 12 is the first time I left my hometown and also the only time before I entered college.

I am studying in Tianjin University, Tianjin. My major is Electronic Engineering. At this moment, I am taking a exchange program in Chang Gung University, Taiwan. My research during postgraduate study is about CUDA. I try to use CUDA to accelerate the process of classfying heart beats. 

I am figuring out what is my lifelong work. 

I like travelling. Accidentally, I joined couchsurfing, which is the begining of my journey. I have been to Vietnam, Cambodia, Malaysia, Phillipine and Iran. Without travelling plans, I enjoy the surprises during the trip.

I like tennis and jogging. Li Na is my favourite tennis star. Serena, Maria and Rafa are my inspirations. I was a overweighted boy. Jogging helped me lose weight and brought me confidence.

I have an unexplainable motivation to explore more in this world. Try to know all the unknow in this mysterious universe in my limited time.

I am honest, easy-going, and always ready to help anyone in need.
